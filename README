This script integrates the sbt (simple-biuld-tool) with Vim. It can be used to develop Java or Scala applications conviniently.
Integrates with vim-addon-actions. You can setup a mapping to run sbt and feed compilation results into quickfix window using both: a background python job or a background sh job.
The pyhton job is using sbt interactive mode so compilation should be fastest.
For large projects you still want to consiider using an IDE..
